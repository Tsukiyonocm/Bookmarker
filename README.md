event.preventDefault() Method (Check MDN).
Why would you need babel in order to use ES6 syntax?




Things I learned:

FlexBox:

Using flexbox, I was having issues trying to left align an item that was being centered align by a previous flex box. I had
tried flex-start aligning things using a new display flex and was running into failure. I didnt think though that it WAS already
left aligned but the container was not being stretched to the extents of the container. I had decided to just move on and come 
back to this later, and in so doing, I realized that once I stretched the contianer, everything was exactly as I learned. 

Moral of the story: I need to better learn to debug CSS better. Using the debugger would have been the first thing i checked
if I had been using JavaScript.

JavaScript:

functionName(event){
    event.preventDefault();
}

The above code will stop a form from submitting to the page.

Objects: This project goes over Objects a bit, which will come handy in my project I wish to work on for
my trivia game and also probably my database for card collections and various other collections.
